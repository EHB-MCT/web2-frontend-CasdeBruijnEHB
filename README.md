**You need to use Dummy account listed at the bottom to save a playlist, other accounts do not have access yet because the Spotify API is still in development mode**

INTRODUCTION
------------

For my coursework of WEBII I created this Playlist generating website with the Spotify API. It has a section where you can generate your own playlist with a short quiz. It's not a regular quiz though, it's a 'visual quiz' where I present you two pictures, and you have to choose the one that represents your mood best.

HOW DOES THE GENERATOR WORK?
------------

The generator gives you a playlist based on your visual preferences. The 'vibe' or 'feeling' a picture gives is usually based on color a lot, that's why the generator also works with colors.
It consists of three rounds, the first round puts you in a certain category. Each category consists of a group of colors; for instance one group is orange, yellow & pink. 
The next two rounds you will receive pictures that are part of this certain category. Each picture has a score here, and according to your endscore, you get a certain playlist.
